netcode.io for Unreal Engine 4
======================================

This project aims to add netcode.io for both desktop platforms and the HTML5 platform targeted by Unreal Engine 4. The aim is to have it such that a HTML5 project exported from UE4 can connected to a dedicated UE4 Linux server over netcode.io.

This is still a work-in-progress and won't work at all yet.

See https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io and https://netcode.redpoint.games/ for demos and more information.
